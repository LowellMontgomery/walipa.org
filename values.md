# Walipa Core Values

## Radical Generosity
We believe in the 99% rule for extreme 
wealth holders. To participate in the 
healing of the planet, those who have 
extracted the most must lead the way in 
returning resources to the commons.

## Environmental Integrity
We do not platform or partner with any 
entity that contributes to the destruction 
of the ecology. If a technology or 
product poisons the soil, the water, 
or the people, it has no place in the 
Walipa ecosystem.

## Pure Production
We advocate for beauty and health 
products that are entirely free of 
neurotoxins and endocrine disruptors. 
"Good production" is the only production 
allowed to participate in our commerce 
flows.

## Traditional Wisdom
We prioritize landrace seeds, permaculture, 
and biodynamic agriculture. We protect the 
botanical wisdom of our ancestors, 
ensuring it remains free from patents 
and corporate control.

## Transparency & Service
Our organization exists to serve the 
living planet. We maintain a lean, 
transparent structure where the 
restoration of the earth is the 
only bottom line.
