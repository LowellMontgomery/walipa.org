# The Walipa Foundation: Membership Values & Accountability

## 1. Stewardship of the Living Planet
We recognize that we are not owners of the Earth, but part of a Living Planet (Walipa). Our mission is to move from extraction to restoration.

## 2. The Ethics Firewall
Technology developed by Walipa—including the Sentinel Membrane—shall never be used to facilitate war, ethnic cleansing, or the arms industry. We prioritize collaboration with indigenous stewards and B-Corps over traditional corporate interests.

## 3. Biological Integrity (Non-Toxicity)
We commit to replacing toxic, petroleum-based permanence with biological grace. Our building blocks are mycelium and minerals, ensuring that even if a child—or a cow—nibbles on our materials, they are nourished, not poisoned.

## 4. Radical Transparency
Every commit to our code and every change to our values is public. We operate as a 'Human Team' where accountability is architected into our digital and physical infrastructure.

## 5. Ancestral Synergy
We humbly seek to repatriate land and wisdom to the original stewards of the planet. The Walipa Land Trust exists to serve the continuity of indigenous heritage.
