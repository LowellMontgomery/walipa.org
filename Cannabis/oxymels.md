# Traditional Medicine: Oxymels

## What is an Oxymel?
An oxymel is an ancient herbal 
preparation (derived from the Greek 
*oxymeli*, meaning "acid and honey"). 
It is a "Solar Plexus Safe" alternative 
to alcohol-based tinctures.

## The Walipa Standard
* **Solvent**: Organic Raw Apple Cider 
  Vinegar (with the "mother").
* **Sweetener**: Raw, local honey from 
  Nevada County or similar bio-regions.
* **Botanicals**: Landrace Cannabis or 
  associated medicinal herbs.

## Basic Preparation
1. **Ratio**: 1 part dry herb to 5 parts 
   liquid (3 parts honey, 2 parts ACV).
2. **Infusion**: Place in a glass jar. 
   Shake daily with **conscious 
   intention** to connect the medicine 
   to the patient.
3. **Time**: Infuse for 2–4 weeks in a 
   cool, dark place.
4. **Strain**: Use organic cheesecloth 
   to remove solids.

## Benefits
Oxymels are particularly effective for 
digestive health and respiratory 
support, providing a grounding, 
non-toxic delivery system for 
landrace plant wisdom.
