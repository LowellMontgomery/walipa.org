# Landrace Cannabis Heritage

## The Walipa Seed Bank
We focus on the preservation of 
pure landrace and heirloom varieties 
adapted to high-elevation, north-facing 
slopes (2500 ft).

## Breeding Philosophy
* **Open Pollination**: We use males 
  to prevent genetic bottlenecking.
* **Rapid Adaptation**: Our lines are 
  allowed to evolve with the seasons.
* **Landrace Focus**: Specializing in 
  Hindu Kush, Pakistani, and other 
  Kush-area genetics.

## Traditional Medicine
We promote the use of cannabis in 
traditional herbal forms, such as:
* **Oxymels**: Herbal extractions using 
  raw honey and apple cider vinegar.
* **Topicals**: Clean-production salves 
  for localized relief.

## Access
Seeds are shared freely within our 
stewardship community. We oppose all 
patents on life-forms.
