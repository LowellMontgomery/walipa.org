# International Contribution Guide

## The 99% Stewardship Path
Walipa invites those who have benefited 
most from the current economic model to 
participate in its transition. For 
extreme wealth holders, we advocate for 
the return of 99% of accumulated 
resources to the living planet.

## How to Contribute
* **Land Trusts**: Facilitating the 
  transfer of private land into 
  perpetual conservation trusts.
* **Direct Funding**: 100% of funds are 
  allocated to land acquisition and 
  restoration projects.
* **Seed Sharing**: Contributing landrace 
  varieties to our global repository.

## Ethical Boundaries
We do not accept contributions from 
ventures that utilize or promote:
* Synthetic neurotoxins.
* Destructive ecological technologies.
* Privatization of essential life 
  elements (water/soil/seeds).
