# Vibrational Stewardship & Sound

## The Frequency of the Forest
Just as we remove chemical toxins from 
the soil, we work to clear vibrational 
"noise" from the atmosphere. Sound is a 
tool for cellular and ecological 
alignment.

## Tools of Resonance
We utilize specific frequencies to 
interact with the living field:
* **Crystal (Cast) Bowls**: Used to 
  ground the energy of a site and 
  harmonize the water molecules in the 
  soil.
* **Tuning Forks**: Applied to 
  specific plants or "meridians" of 
  the land to stimulate growth and 
  resilience.
* **Vocal Toning**: Using the human 
  voice (as seen in the Ankh-centered 
  traditions) to bridge the physical 
  and spiritual stewardship.

## Habitat for All
We recognize that every sound—from the 
Barred Owl to the tuning fork—is part 
of the current local frequency. Our 
goal is not to exclude, but to create 
a habitat deep and diverse enough 
that all species can find their 
rightful resonance without 
displacement.
