# Botanical & Personal Safety

## The Walipa Standard
We only recognize "Good Production" 
methods. Any botanical or personal 
care resource shared here must be:
* Free of synthetic neurotoxins.
* Free of endocrine disruptors.
* Biodegradable and soil-safe.

## The Fragrance Loophole
We do not platform products that 
hide chemicals under "Fragrance" 
or "Parfum" labels. We prioritize 
whole-plant extracts and essential 
oils over synthetic musks.

## Community Vetting
If a product or practice causes 
physical distress or environmental 
harm, it is removed from our 
resource flow. We rely on the 
collective sensitivity of our 
members to maintain this sanctuary.
