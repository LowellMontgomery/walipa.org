# Walipa Global Translation Guide

We use AI to provide the first draft of our mission, but only **you** can provide the soul of the language. Help us ensure the Walipa Foundation speaks clearly to every culture.

### **How to Correct a Translation**
1. **Find the Error**: Browse the documents in this repository.
2. **Suggest a Fix**: 
   * If you use GitHub: Click the "Edit" (pencil) icon and submit a **Pull Request**.
   * If you use Trello: Post the corrected text on our **[International Trello Board]**.
3. **The Feedback Loop**: Your corrections will be pushed to the live site and used to help "train" our internal translation models to be more accurate for everyone.

### **Style Guidelines**
* **Holistic Terms**: For plant names (like *Chamaebatia foliolosa*), please keep the botanical name alongside your local common name.
* **Tone**: We strive for an empathetic, intellectual, and transparent tone—similar to the spirit of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
