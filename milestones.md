## 🚀 Milestone: Anthem Integration & Digital Infrastructure

We are moving closer to the "Live" state for **Walipa.org**. Recent updates include the finalization of our foundational anthem and preparations for our global multi-domain rollout.

### 🎵 Cultural Anchor: "Is There for Honest Poverty"
The 2026 inclusive adaptation of Robert Burns' classic is now "feature-complete." After several iterative commits to refine the meter and ensure the light Scottish dialect remains accessible, the song is ready to serve as our central anthem.

* **Primary Version:** [Link directly to your Song file here]
* **Significance:** This version refactors the "Brotherhood of Man" into a kinship of all living beings, aligning with the Walipa mission.

### 🌐 Technical Progress: Drupal & Multi-Domain Rollout
* **Open Social Fork:** We are finalizing the master settings for our custom Drupal Open Social fork. 
* **Global Architecture:** Preparations are underway to launch localized versions of Walipa under specific country and language domains (e.g., .de, .fr, .es) to ensure the message of the "Living Planet" is natively accessible worldwide.
* **Core Contribution:** During the Siteground deployment, we identified and are working on a small core contribution—giving back to the Drupal ecosystem that powers our optics.

### 🌞 The Path Ahead
As we secure funding for our global domain registrations, we will begin translating the Walipa vision—and its anthem—into the languages of the world.

*“That everyone the world o’er / Shall be as one, for a’ that.”*
