# 🎵 The Walipa Anthem: Is There for Honest Poverty 

> "The pith o’ Sense an’ pride o’ Worth / Are higher rank than a’ that."

## 🌎 Connection to Walipa
At the heart of **Walipa (We Are the Living Planet)** is the conviction that value is inherent in life itself, not in titles, wealth, or human-centric hierarchies. 

This anthem is a 2026 modernization of Robert Burns’ classic 1795 poem. While the original was a revolutionary cry for the dignity of the "common man," this adaptation extends that circle of dignity to **every living soul**—human and non-human alike.

## 🕊 Why This Song?
The song serves as a cultural protocol for our mission:
* **The Gold vs. The Stamp:** Just as a coin's value is in the gold, not the official stamp, a planet's value is in its living systems, not its economic metrics.
* **Independent Mind:** We celebrate the "folk o’ independent mind" who look beyond "tinsel show" to see the "pith o' sense" in our ecological reality.
* **Universal Kinship:** The final vision—"That everyone the world o'er / Shall be as one"—is the ultimate goal of Walipa.
