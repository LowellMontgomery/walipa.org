# Participation via Conscious Intention

## The Inward Contact
Stewardship at Walipa is an act of 
conscious alignment. We do not "imagine" 
a connection; we hold a **deliberate 
intention** to commune with the living 
intelligence of the planet.

## Nightly Protocol
Before rest, hold the following 
intentions to connect with the project:
* **The Central Root**: Intend to meet 
  the Walipa stewards in the shared 
  field of the living earth.
* **The Listening Will**: Intend to be 
  a receptor for the earth's specific 
  needs regarding soil, seed, or 
  sanctuary.
* **The Retrieval**: Intend to bring 
  back the "blueprints" or insights 
  received for waking implementation 
 .

## Collective Data
We treat insights received through 
conscious intention as vital data for 
our stewardship efforts.
