# Participation via Conscious Intention

## Beyond Imagination
Stewardship at Walipa is an act of 
conscious alignment. We do not merely 
"imagine" a connection; we hold a 
**deliberate intention** to commune with 
the living intelligence of the planet.

## Nightly Protocol
Before rest, hold the following 
intentions to connect with the project:

* **The Central Root**: Intend to meet 
  the Walipa stewards in the shared 
  field of the living earth.
* **The Listening Will**: Intend to be 
  a receptor for the earth's specific 
  needs regarding soil, seed, or 
  sanctuary.
* **The Retrieval**: Intend to bring 
  back the "blueprints" or insights 
  received for waking implementation 
 .

## Submission of Insights
We recognize two forms of participation 
in this process:

1. **Dream-World Submission**: If you 
   have already finalized your 
   transmission and "sent" the data 
   within the dream world itself, your 
   work is complete. The intention is 
   already rooted in the living field.
2. **Waking Transmission**: If you 
   find yourself still "channeling" or 
   processing the data upon waking, you 
   may use the digital form to anchor 
   those insights into our waking 
   repository.

## Collective Data
We treat all insights received through 
conscious intention as vital data for 
our stewardship efforts. 
Whether submitted internally or 
digitally, these visions form the 
foundation of our physical work.
