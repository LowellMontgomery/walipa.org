# Walipa Stewardship Guide

## Soil Restoration
We utilize biodynamic and permaculture 
principles to return life to the earth. 
Our primary focus is building fungal 
networks and increasing organic matter 
through:
* Sheet mulching and no-till practices.
* Use of native, landrace cover crops.
* Biodynamic compost preparations.

## Forest Protection
Our mixed deciduous and pine forests are 
living lungs. Stewardship includes:
* Protecting old-growth characteristics.
* Managing invasive species without 
  synthetic toxins.
* Creating wildlife corridors and 
  protected habitats.

## Landrace Seed Saving
Seeds are a common heritage. We maintain 
and distribute open-source, landrace 
varieties adapted to the 2500 ft 
elevation of Nevada County.
