# Walipa Board & Governance

## Non-Hierarchical Leadership
Walipa operates as a collective of 
stewards rather than a corporate 
hierarchy. Decisions regarding land 
trusts and resource allocation are 
made through consensus.

## Zero-Salary Policy
To ensure radical transparency and 
maximum ecological impact, all board 
members and directors serve on a 
voluntary basis. 100% of external 
contributions are directed to:
* Land acquisition for trusts.
* Soil restoration projects.
* Forest protection initiatives.

## Accountability
We maintain an open-source record of 
all foundation activities on our 
GitHub repository.
