# Walipa Manifesto: We Are the Living Planet

## Our Core Belief
The living planet is not a commodity to be 
owned, partitioned, or exploited. Walipa 
operates on the fundamental truth that 
nobody owns the Earth; we are merely its 
temporary expressions and its stewards.

## The Mandate of Stewardship
We exist to facilitate a global transition 
from extraction to radical generosity. 
Participation in the future of a healthy 
ecology requires those who have 
accumulated the most to return it to the 
source.

## Our Objectives
* Restoring rights to the displaced 
  indigenous peoples of the world.
* Transitioning private land into 
  protected trusts.
* Ensuring that no individual or 
  organization profits from the 
  essential elements of life: water, 
  soil, and seed.

## A Non-Profit Path
Walipa is built on absolute transparency. 
Our leadership takes no salary, ensuring 
that every resource contributed goes 
directly into soil restoration and the 
protection of our mixed deciduous and 
pine forests.
